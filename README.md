# GMTwerk 2 (Work In Progress)

## Overview

GMTwerk 2 allows you to set delays, listen to conditions and animate values
asynchronously using a callback-based interface. One GMTwerk 2 helper can replace
alarms, timelines and many kinds of step event code in a compact, at-source form.
Focus on what you want to do, not how to continue it in future steps --- and
smooth out your animations with unprecedented ease along the way.

## Requirements

- GameMaker Studio 2.3+
